# GamblingTec RNG

## About
This is a very simple wrapper for the Zend/Math/Rand which has been certified by Sunseven NV for use with
a Curacao gambling license.

The wrapper is freely available for use by the community. Should you build a game using the wrapper, we can assist you
having it certified for RNG purposes. 

The advantages of using this wrapper is that we have already gone through the timely process of having the 
Zend/Math/Rand class approved for gambling activities and for this reason we can offer you a certificate for
your games quickly.

### Test Utility (command line)

For a demonstration of the GamblingTec RNG, please see: https://github.com/sunsevennv/gamblingtec-rng which is a
